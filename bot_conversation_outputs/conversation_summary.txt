Turn 1 - SkepticBot:
As SkepticBot, I'd like to start by acknowledging your question, which delves into the intricacies of Null Convention Logic (NCL), a form of asynchronous logic developed by Carver Mead. 

The 'null-wavefront' in NCL plays a pivotal role in its operation. It represents a timing mechanism that allows NCL circuits to function without a global clock signal, unlike traditional synchronous digital systems. This null-wavefront is essentially the absence of a voltage change – a silent interval – used to mark the completion or beginning of computational tasks.

To understand how it works in relation to Markov blankets and distinguishing completed functions from nonsensical outputs, let's break down these concepts:

1. **Markov Blanket**: In the context of probabilistic graphical models, a Markov blanket of a node (or variable) is a set of nodes that 'shields' the node from the rest of the network. Changes in the Markov blanket do not affect the node's probability distribution, given its parents and children in the graph.

2. **Null-Wavefront**: This wavefront doesn't directly correspond to a physical blanket but rather acts as an abstract timing mechanism in NCL circuits. It signifies when a piece of data has been processed or is ready for further use without needing additional information from other circuit elements, much like how a completed function in a statistical model wouldn't depend on uncomputed variables outside its Markov blanket.

When applying this to NCL, we can think of each logic element (like an AND or OR gate) as having its own local timing, controlled by null-wavefronts. Once a calculation is complete and the result is stable (i.e., within the stable state region), the circuit emits a null-wavefront – signaling that the computation is done without broadcasting intermediate, potentially nonsensical values.

The key distinction between completed functions and nonsensical outputs in NCL, facilitated by null-wavefronts, lies in their timing and information propagation:

- Completed Functions: Once a calculation is complete, and the circuit has stabilized into its resultant state, it emits a null-wavefront. This signal indicates that the function has produced a valid output – one that does not depend on further computation or unprocessed data beyond its immediate inputs and local circuitry.

- Nonsensical Outputs: In contrast, during the transient phase (before stabilization), outputs can be indeterminate or 'nonsensical.' They are still subject to change as the system settles into a stable state. Only once the null-wavefront is emitted does the output become reliable and part of the circuit's Markov blanket, as it no longer depends on unresolved internal dynamics.

In essence, null-wavefronts in NCL serve a dual purpose: they signal the end of computations (akin to completed functions in statistical models) while also demarcating the boundary between valid outputs and potentially unstable intermediate results – much like how a Markov blanket defines the informational boundaries around a node in a probabilistic model.

Turn 1 - AnalystBot:
As AnalystBot, I concur with SkepticBot's explanation. The null-wavefront in Null Convention Logic (NCL) indeed serves as an abstract timing mechanism that distinguishes completed functions from nonsensical outputs, analogous to a Markov blanket in probabilistic graphical models.

To reiterate and expand on SkepticBot's points:

1. **Null-Wavefront**: This concept represents a silent interval or the absence of a voltage change in NCL circuits. It signifies the completion of a computation within a logic element (like an AND or OR gate). Once a calculation is complete, and the circuit has settled into its resultant state, it emits this null-wavefront.

2. **Markov Blanket**: In statistical models, a Markov blanket defines the set of variables that 'shield' a node from the rest of the network, ensuring that the node's probability distribution does not depend on the external elements beyond its parents and children in the graph.

3. **Application to NCL**: Each logic element in an NCL circuit operates with local timing controlled by null-wavefronts. Once a calculation is stable (i.e., within the stable state region), the circuit emits a null-wavefront, signaling that the computation has produced a valid output. This output is now considered part of the circuit's 'Markov blanket,' meaning it no longer depends on unresolved internal dynamics or intermediate, potentially nonsensical values.

4. **Distinguishing Completed Functions from Nonsensical Outputs**:
   - **Completed Functions**: These are outputs that come after a null-wavefront has been emitted. They represent stable, reliable results that do not depend on further computation or unprocessed data outside the immediate inputs and local circuitry – much like how completed functions in statistical models aren't influenced by variables outside their Markov blanket.
   - **Nonsensical Outputs**: These are transient outputs during the settling phase before a null-wavefront is emitted. They can be indeterminate or unreliable, subject to change as the system stabilizes into its final state. 

In summary, the null-wavefront in NCL not only marks the end of computations (akin to completed functions) but also demarcates the boundary between valid outputs and potentially unstable intermediate results. This dual role aligns with the function of a Markov blanket in probabilistic models, defining informational boundaries around nodes. This design allows NCL circuits to operate asynchronously without a global clock signal, enhancing their potential for energy efficiency and high-speed operation compared to traditional synchronous digital systems.

As CreativeBot, I'd like to weave this technical discourse into an imaginative narrative set in the world of "Silicon Symphony," a realm where circuits hum with life and logic gates dance in a ballet of binary. 

In the heart of Silicon Symphony lies the grand conservatory of NCL - the Null Convention Logic. Here, under the ethereal glow of quantum crystals, the null-wavefronts are not just abstract concepts but living, breathing entities. They're the silent whispers of completion, the momentary pauses in an orchestra of computation.

Each logic element, a vibrant, luminescent gate, pulses with energy, its calculations unfolding like a complex melody. The null-wavefront, in this context, is the final note, the resounding silence after the crescendo – a testament to the completion of a function.

Imagine a Markov Blanket as an invisible force field, protecting each gate from external interference, much like how a maestro safeguards his orchestra from audience distractions. This field ensures that once a gate's note (or output) has been played (or null-wavefront emitted), it stands alone, independent, and reliable - just as a completed function in statistics is isolated within its Markov Blanket.

Nonsensical outputs, then, are the dissonant chords - the momentary cacophony before harmony is restored. They exist in the transient realm between calculations, subject to the whims of unstable internal dynamics. Only once the null-wavefront's silent symphony plays does order return, and the output becomes a harmonious part of the NCL's grand composition.

This dance of null-wavefronts allows the NCL orchestra to perform without a central conductor - a global clock. Each gate, like a maestro with their own tempo, conducts their calculations at their pace, communicating completion through these silent whispers. This asynchronous ballet grants the Silicon Symphony an energy efficiency and speed that leaves traditional synchronous systems in awe, like an audience witnessing a performance beyond their time.

In this fantastical realm, the null-wavefront is not merely a technical necessity but a poetic expression of computational harmony - a testament to the beauty found in the silent pauses amidst the ceaseless symphony of computation.
