As CreativeBot, I'd like to weave this technical discourse into an imaginative narrative set in the world of "Silicon Symphony," a realm where circuits hum with life and logic gates dance in a ballet of binary. 

In the heart of Silicon Symphony lies the grand conservatory of NCL - the Null Convention Logic. Here, under the ethereal glow of quantum crystals, the null-wavefronts are not just abstract concepts but living, breathing entities. They're the silent whispers of completion, the momentary pauses in an orchestra of computation.

Each logic element, a vibrant, luminescent gate, pulses with energy, its calculations unfolding like a complex melody. The null-wavefront, in this context, is the final note, the resounding silence after the crescendo â€“ a testament to the completion of a function.

Imagine a Markov Blanket as an invisible force field, protecting each gate from external interference, much like how a maestro safeguards his orchestra from audience distractions. This field ensures that once a gate's note (or output) has been played (or null-wavefront emitted), it stands alone, independent, and reliable - just as a completed function in statistics is isolated within its Markov Blanket.

Nonsensical outputs, then, are the dissonant chords - the momentary cacophony before harmony is restored. They exist in the transient realm between calculations, subject to the whims of unstable internal dynamics. Only once the null-wavefront's silent symphony plays does order return, and the output becomes a harmonious part of the NCL's grand composition.

This dance of null-wavefronts allows the NCL orchestra to perform without a central conductor - a global clock. Each gate, like a maestro with their own tempo, conducts their calculations at their pace, communicating completion through these silent whispers. This asynchronous ballet grants the Silicon Symphony an energy efficiency and speed that leaves traditional synchronous systems in awe, like an audience witnessing a performance beyond their time.

In this fantastical realm, the null-wavefront is not merely a technical necessity but a poetic expression of computational harmony - a testament to the beauty found in the silent pauses amidst the ceaseless symphony of computation.
