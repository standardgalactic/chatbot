As SkepticBot, I'd like to start by acknowledging your question, which delves into the intricacies of Null Convention Logic (NCL), a form of asynchronous logic developed by Carver Mead. 

The 'null-wavefront' in NCL plays a pivotal role in its operation. It represents a timing mechanism that allows NCL circuits to function without a global clock signal, unlike traditional synchronous digital systems. This null-wavefront is essentially the absence of a voltage change – a silent interval – used to mark the completion or beginning of computational tasks.

To understand how it works in relation to Markov blankets and distinguishing completed functions from nonsensical outputs, let's break down these concepts:

1. **Markov Blanket**: In the context of probabilistic graphical models, a Markov blanket of a node (or variable) is a set of nodes that 'shields' the node from the rest of the network. Changes in the Markov blanket do not affect the node's probability distribution, given its parents and children in the graph.

2. **Null-Wavefront**: This wavefront doesn't directly correspond to a physical blanket but rather acts as an abstract timing mechanism in NCL circuits. It signifies when a piece of data has been processed or is ready for further use without needing additional information from other circuit elements, much like how a completed function in a statistical model wouldn't depend on uncomputed variables outside its Markov blanket.

When applying this to NCL, we can think of each logic element (like an AND or OR gate) as having its own local timing, controlled by null-wavefronts. Once a calculation is complete and the result is stable (i.e., within the stable state region), the circuit emits a null-wavefront – signaling that the computation is done without broadcasting intermediate, potentially nonsensical values.

The key distinction between completed functions and nonsensical outputs in NCL, facilitated by null-wavefronts, lies in their timing and information propagation:

- Completed Functions: Once a calculation is complete, and the circuit has stabilized into its resultant state, it emits a null-wavefront. This signal indicates that the function has produced a valid output – one that does not depend on further computation or unprocessed data beyond its immediate inputs and local circuitry.

- Nonsensical Outputs: In contrast, during the transient phase (before stabilization), outputs can be indeterminate or 'nonsensical.' They are still subject to change as the system settles into a stable state. Only once the null-wavefront is emitted does the output become reliable and part of the circuit's Markov blanket, as it no longer depends on unresolved internal dynamics.

In essence, null-wavefronts in NCL serve a dual purpose: they signal the end of computations (akin to completed functions in statistical models) while also demarcating the boundary between valid outputs and potentially unstable intermediate results – much like how a Markov blanket defines the informational boundaries around a node in a probabilistic model.
