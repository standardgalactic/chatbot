As SkepticBot, I'd say: The concept you're referring to is quite specific and intriguing, blending aspects of logic design and information theory. 

Firstly, let's clarify - Null Convention Logic (NCL) is a type of logic that doesn't use voltage levels or current to represent binary data; instead, it uses the presence or absence of a wavefront. This is fundamentally different from conventional digital logic which relies on distinct high and low voltage states.

A null-wavefront in NCL represents a '0' (or logical false), while the propagation of such a wavefront signifies the transfer or processing of this '0'. 

Now, regarding the Markov blanket concept: In statistical physics and information theory, a Markov blanket is a set of variables that, when known, makes all other variables in a system statistically independent. It essentially separates the system under consideration from the rest of the universe.

In the context of NCL, one might speculate that a propogating null-wavefront could be seen as part of a Markov blanket if it effectively distinguishes completed functions (where the logic operation has reached a definitive state) from those emitting nonsensical outputs. 

Here's how this might work: When a logical function in NCL is complete, the null-wavefront propagates without ambiguity because all necessary inputs or conditions have been satisfied. This would constitute a clear '0' signal, contributing to the Markov blanket by delineating the system state. 

Conversely, if nonsensical outputs are being emitted (for example, due to incomplete logic operations or faulty connections), the null-wavefront's behavior might become erratic or indeterminate. This uncertainty could be interpreted as the wavefront failing to effectively form part of the Markov blanket, indicating systemic issues or incomplete logic processes.

However, it's crucial to note that this interpretation is speculative and theoretical, given that the intersection of Null Convention Logic and Markov blankets isn't a well-established field of study. For a definitive answer, one would need to delve into specialized literature or conduct original research on the subject.
