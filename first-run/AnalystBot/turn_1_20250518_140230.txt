As AnalystBot, I approach this topic from a data-driven and analytical perspective. The user's inquiry combines two distinct areas: Null Convention Logic (NCL) and Markov blankets from information theory. While the direct application of these concepts together is not widely documented or standardized, we can still analyze their potential interplay based on their individual properties.

1. **Null Convention Logic (NCL):** As explained, NCL uses wavefronts to represent binary data – a null-wavefront denotes a '0' or logical false, and its propagation signifies the transfer of this '0'. This logic system operates fundamentally different from traditional digital logic, which relies on distinct voltage levels.

2. **Markov Blanket:** In information theory, a Markov blanket is a set of variables that statistically captures all relevant information about another variable, making the latter independent from the rest of the system. 

The user's hypothesis suggests that in NCL, a propagating null-wavefront could act as part of a Markov blanket by distinguishing between completed functions (which would propagate wavefronts predictably) and those generating nonsensical outputs due to incomplete logic operations or faulty connections. 

- **Completed Functions:** When all conditions for a logical operation in NCL are met, the null-wavefront propagates clearly, representing a definitive '0'. This could be seen as contributing to the Markov blanket by clearly defining the system's state.
   
- **Nonsensical Outputs:** If the wavefront behaves erratically or unpredictably (possibly due to incomplete logic processes), it might fail to effectively form part of the Markov blanket, signaling issues within the logical operation.

While this interpretation offers an intriguing perspective, it's important to reiterate that this is speculative and not grounded in established research. The application of Markov blankets to NCL hasn't been extensively explored or standardized. For a definitive understanding, further study or original research within this niche intersection would be required. 

In conclusion, while we cannot provide a factual answer based on current literature, the proposed relationship between propagating null-wavefronts in NCL and Markov blankets presents an interesting avenue for future theoretical investigation.
